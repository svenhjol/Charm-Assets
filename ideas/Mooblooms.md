# Mooblooms

The mob that should have made it into the game :)  Target: 1.16

* Spawns in flower forest biomes.
* 9 variants, one for each suspicious stew flower variant.
* Right-click with bowl to get a suspicious stew of the corresponding moobloom flower type.
* Time delay in how often then can provide stew.  Bee pollination resets the timer.
