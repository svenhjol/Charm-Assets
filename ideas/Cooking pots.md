* A **Cooking pot** holds food (in the form of a stew).
* To start, you have to fill the cooking pot with water and put it on the block above a fire (campfire, soul campfire or normal fire block)
* Right-click on a cooking pot with any food to add it to the pot.
* A cooking pot holds **64** food items.
* Right-click on a cooking pot with a bowl to get a filled bowl of stew.
* Right-click on a cooking pot with a **flask** to add the equivalent of one bowl of stew to the flask.

## Cooking pot: Mixing

* The cooking pot takes an **average** of the hunger and saturation of all food items added.
* Adding food that gives an effect (e.g. rotten flesh, suspicious stew etc) has a chance to **taint** the entire stew, giving you that effect for every bowl taken.

## Cooking pot: Misc

* As you take food from the cooking pot, the level of the stew in the pot visually decreases
* Adding food to the pot visually increases the level of the stew.
* Extinguishing the fire means you can no longer add food to the pot, but you can still take contents.  Restoring the fire allows you to add food again.
* Once a pot is completely empty (the last bowl of stew is taken), you have to add water to add more food.
* Breaking a pot does **not** lose its contents.
