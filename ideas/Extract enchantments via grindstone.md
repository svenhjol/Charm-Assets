# Extract enchantments via grindstone

Grindstone is a better fit than anvil for extraction of enchantments to a book.  Target: 1.16

I spoke with the author of [Grind Enchantments](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grind-enchantments) and they agreed to allow the code to be merged into Charm with attribution.
