# Flasks

Crafted with leather and copper (Recipe TBC).
Inspired by bundles.

* A **flask** holds liquids **or** food (in the form of stew).
* It stores the equivalent of 64 potion/water bottles **or** 64 bowls of stew.
* Right-click and hold a flask to consume the equivalent of one bottle or bowl of the flask contents.
* When the flask is depleted, it does not expire.
