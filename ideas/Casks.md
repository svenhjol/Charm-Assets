# Casks

Crafted from wood and copper like a barrel, but the slabs are copper. Target: 1.17, could backport to 1.16

* A **cask** holds potions (and water).
* Right-click on a cask with a filled bottle to add the contents to the cask (and return the bottle)
* A cask holds **64** bottles of liquid.
* Right-click on a cask with an empty bottle to get one filled bottle of the cask contents.
* Right-click on a cask with a **flask** to add the equivalent of one bottle to the flask.

## Casks: Mixing

* The cask takes an **average** of the lengths and strengths of all potions added.
* Adding water to a cask of potion dilutes the potion (reduces its amplifier and duration).
* Combining more than one kind of potion risks the contents becoming **dubious**.
* Right-clicking on a dubious cask gets you a potion bottle that  gives you the combined potion effect but with a chance of negative effects.
* The more you mix, the more chance the resulting potion will be crappy.

## Casks: Aging

* As a cask ages, the duration bonus of the contained potion will increase.

## Casks: Misc

* Breaking a cask does **not** lose its contents.
* Will probably be the POIT for the Innkeeper (Strange).
