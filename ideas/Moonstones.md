# Moonstones

An item that changes the colors of enchantment glints, nether portals, and allows End Portals to link together.

This has been through many revisions and is still provisional.  Target: 1.16

## Moonstone geodes
* Found in floating geodes around the End Islands
* A type of End Stone (moonstone-bearing end stone?) that grows moonstone crystal blocks like amethyst crystals in the overworld.
* Break the crystal to get a single moonstone
* Geodes contain maximum 2 colors
* Crystals give off low light

## Enchantment coloring
* Use on an anvil to apply the color to an enchanted item (includes lodestone compasses)
* Consumes the moonstone

## Nether portal coloring
* Right click on a portal block with a moonstone to change the color of all connected portal blocks
* Consumes the moonstone

## End portal linking
* Complete an End portal with 12 moonstones
* Completing another portal with the same configuration of moonstone colors will link them together
* This will be verrrrry useful in Strange because some ruins (and possibly foundations) will contain End Portals. Possible fast travel across vast distance.
