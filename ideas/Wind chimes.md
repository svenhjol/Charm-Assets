* Wind chimes hang similar to lanterns.
* When a mob or player passes by them, they activate.
* Checks the weather ticks, and every X ticks will ring with increasing volume and sound complexity until the weather changes.
* Projectile impact causes them to activate.
* When they ring they emit a redstone signal.
